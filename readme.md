# Fair Warning

I make no attempt to write clever code, so you won't find ultra-short solutions here.  I use advanced language techniques where they make sense to use in my mind, which isn't necessarily everywhere they could be used.

I also write code that follows the breakdown of steps needed to solve a particular problem (as that breakdown happens in my mind).  My first solutions to problems tend to be verbose and straightforward.  My normal process would be to then refactor and optimize once I understand all the factors in the problem.  That step hasn't happened in any of these challenge.

So if you're looking for ultra short or ultra efficient code, look elsewhere.  These solutions are a peek into how my mind works when it's solving problems.
